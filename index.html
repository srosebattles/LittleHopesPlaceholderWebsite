            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <div class="aboutText">
                <p>Little Hopes exists for community members to help each other live with dignity by providing support and hope to those who are struggling. We provide our clients with household items, car repairs, medical costs, school supplies, clothing, holiday and birthday gifts, and other items they need but could not otherwise afford. We aim to provide stability and dignity while meeting our clients needs.</p>
            </div>
            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <div class="aboutText">
                <p>Our vision is to create an inclusive environment based in mutual respect where neighbors can give and receive support. Little Hopes believes it is not enough to survive. We must help each other break the cycles of poverty. When we help our neighbors thrive, our community will also thrive.</p>
            </div>
            <h2>Where We Work Together</h2>
            <div class="aboutText">
                <p>Our clients (who are also Little Hopes supporters themselves) live in St. Anthony Park or in the Hamline-Midway, Dale-Thomas ("Frogtown"), Como Park, North End, and Rondo neighborhoods in St. Paul. We welcome supporters from all over the Twin Cities and beyond!</p>
                <p>Anyone at any income level may join to support the community; those who receive material assistance via Little Hopes are those who receive (or would qualify for) other forms of assistance such as SNAP, TANF, regular food shelf support or are otherwise able to demonstrate they are worried about being able to meet basic needs.</p>
